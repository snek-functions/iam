    Groups are a generic way of categorizing users to apply permissions, or
    some other label, to those users. A user can belong to any number of
    groups.
    A user in a group automatically has all the permissions granted to that
    group. For example, if the group 'Site editors' has the permission
    can_edit_home_page, any user in that group will have that permission.
    Beyond permissions, groups are a convenient way to categorize users to
    apply some label, or extended functionality, to them. For example, you
    could create a group 'Special users', and you could write code that would
    do special things to those users -- such as giving them access to a
    members-only portion of your site, or sending them members-only email
    messages.
